    <p>As children grow, they are expected to be able to write their ideas in simple sentences weaved into a paragraph. Let us help them write a small composition on their favourite food in about 150 words:

        My favourite food is a burger. It has many layers of fresh vegetables, sauces and a patty filled between two buns. A burger is a fun dish, and everyone at home enjoys eating it. Many restaurants serve delicious burgers, but I love the one my mother makes at home. I love the taste of the fresh, crunchy lettuce leaves, the tangy tomatoes and the cheese that melts in the mouth. Burgers are my favourite 4 pm snack, and my mom always makes it as healthy as she can! I love every bite! </p>

    <p>I love eating delicious food, but of them all, pizza is my favourite. It originated in Italy many years ago. A pizza is made of a round flat base, spread with a special pizza sauce and lots of toppings like tomatoes, basil, onions, jalapenos, capsicum, mushroom or meat. To top it all, there is lots of cheese, which is my favourite part!
         My mother bakes delicious pizzas at home. On every special occasion, we all enjoy her homemade pizzas. She makes them from scratch, right from making the base. She puts lots of vegetables on top, mixed with mushrooms to make it healthier and more nutritious. I love each bite of the crispy crust with the vegetables and cheese. It is healthy and full of nutritious ingredients and also very yummy. I look forward to the days when we have pizza for dinner!</p>

    <p>My favourite food is a homely meal of rajma and chawal. This dish originates from the state of Punjab and has become a hot favourite all over the country! It is a combination of kidney beans (rajma) slow-cooked in a flavourful curry, served with rice. I find the taste of rajma chawal delicious! This food is also very healthy and gives us energy because it is packed with nutrition. We get lots of protein from the beans, and rice gives us the right amount of carbohydrates. My mother makes rajma chawal every Sunday for lunch, and my whole family sits together and enjoys it. It is our comfort food. I like adding some lemon juice to the rajma for the tanginess it gives. I love it because it is yummy, healthy and because we always have a great time while enjoying this sumptuous meal!</p>

     <!-- article  --> 
    <p>Machher Jhol has an intensely flavourful and aromatic taste. The combination of spices and ingredients used in the dish gives it an unmistakable flavour and aroma. Furthermore, the dish is also quite nutritious, as it is rich in protein, vitamins, and minerals.
        Another reason why Machher Jhol is one of my favourite dishes is the versatility of it. You can make the dish in different ways depending on the ingredients you have. Different vegetables and fish can be used, and you can vary the spices and add different flavourings. This means you can always try something new, exploring the different flavours arising from the same set of ingredients.</p>
